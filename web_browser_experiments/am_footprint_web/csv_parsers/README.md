## CSV Parsers
This repository contains scripts to parse telemetry generated csv files for memory and loading benchmarks.

### how to run parsers?
you can run these parser scripts using python3 as:
```terminal
$ python3 mem_process_files.py /path/to/csv.file
```
You have to set path to csv as argument in the command.

This will produce a parsed file in the same directory.
